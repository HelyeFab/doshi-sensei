# Doshi Sensei Implementation Roadmap

## Project Overview

Doshi Sensei is a Next.js application designed to help users learn and practice Japanese verb and adjective conjugations. This document outlines the complete implementation roadmap to achieve the MVP requirements.

## Current Status

The application currently has:
- Home page with navigation to all sections
- Vocabulary browsing with search and filtering by JLPT level
- Drill mode with multiple choice questions
- Conjugation engine that can generate all forms

Missing features:
- Practice Mode (detailed conjugation view)
- Settings Page
- Integration between features
- Statistics tracking

## Implementation Priority

Based on the MVP requirements and current implementation status, here is the prioritized implementation plan:

1. **Practice Mode** - Core feature for viewing detailed conjugations
2. **Settings Page** - User customization options
3. **Feature Integration** - Connect all features for a seamless experience
4. **Statistics & Progress** - Track user progress and display statistics
5. **UI Polish & Optimization** - Final refinements and performance improvements

## Phase 1: Practice Mode (8-13 days)

The Practice Mode is a core feature that allows users to view and study detailed conjugations of Japanese verbs and adjectives.

### Key Components

1. Practice page with word selection
2. Detailed conjugation display
3. Conjugation rule explanations
4. Integration with vocabulary page

See [Practice Mode Implementation Plan](./practice_mode_implementation_plan.md) for detailed breakdown.

## Phase 2: Settings Page (6-10 days)

The Settings page allows users to customize their experience in Doshi Sensei.

### Key Components

1. Theme switching (Dark/Light mode)
2. Display preferences (Romaji toggle, language)
3. Progress tracking and goals
4. Data management options

See [Settings Page Implementation Plan](./settings_page_implementation_plan.md) for detailed breakdown.

## Phase 3: Feature Integration (3-5 days)

Connect all features for a seamless user experience.

### Tasks

1. **Navigation Flow Improvements**
   - Add breadcrumb navigation
   - Implement consistent back button behavior
   - Create smooth transitions between pages

2. **Cross-Feature Actions**
   - Add "Practice" button in Drill Mode results
   - Enable direct navigation from Vocabulary to Practice or Drill
   - Allow switching between Practice and Drill for the same word

3. **State Persistence**
   - Preserve search/filter state between navigation
   - Remember last viewed words
   - Save user preferences across sessions

4. **Shared Components**
   - Create reusable word card component
   - Implement consistent loading states
   - Standardize error handling

## Phase 4: Statistics & Progress Tracking (4-7 days)

Implement features to track and display user progress.

### Tasks

1. **Data Storage**
   - Create progress data structure
   - Implement local storage persistence
   - Add data migration for updates

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - Track completed drills
   - Record practice sessions
   - Calculate accuracy statistics

3. **Dashboard Updates**
   - Update home page statistics cards
   - Add progress visualization
   - Implement streak tracking

4. **Achievements**
   - Create achievement system
   - Add milestone notifications
   - Implement daily goals

## Phase 5: UI Polish & Optimization (3-5 days)

Final refinements to ensure a polished user experience.

### Tasks

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add data caching
   - Optimize component rendering

2. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Add keyboard navigation
   - Improve screen reader support
   - Enhance focus management

3. **Animation & Transitions**
   - Add page transitions
   - Implement micro-interactions
   - Create feedback animations

4. **Responsive Design Refinements**
   - Test on various screen sizes
   - Optimize for mobile devices
   - Improve touch interactions

## Technical Considerations

### State Management

The application currently uses React's built-in state management with useState and useEffect. As features grow, consider:

1. Creating context providers for shared state:
   - SettingsContext
   - ProgressContext
   - VocabularyContext

2. Implementing custom hooks for common operations:
   - useConjugation
   - useVocabulary
   - useProgress

### Data Storage

The application stores data locally without a backend:

1. Use localStorage for:
   - User settings
   - Progress data
   - Recently viewed words

2. Consider IndexedDB for:
   - Caching vocabulary data
   - Storing larger datasets
   - Offline support

### Component Architecture

As the application grows, maintain a clear component hierarchy:

1. Page components (src/app/*/page.tsx)
2. Feature-specific components (src/components/feature/*)
3. Shared UI components (src/components/ui/*)
4. Layout components (src/components/layout/*)

## Timeline Summary

| Phase | Feature | Estimated Duration |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | Practice Mode | 8-13 days |
| 2 | Settings Page | 6-10 days |
| 3 | Feature Integration | 3-5 days |
| 4 | Statistics & Progress | 4-7 days |
| 5 | UI Polish & Optimization | 3-5 days |
| **Total** | | **24-40 days** |

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Practice Mode
2. Create basic Settings Page structure
3. Plan for feature integration
4. Design progress tracking system

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. **Audio Pronunciation**
   - Add audio playback for words and conjugations
   - Implement speech recognition for practice

2. **Example Sentences**
   - Include contextual examples for each conjugation
   - Add sentence translation

3. **Spaced Repetition**
   - Implement SRS algorithm for optimized learning
   - Add review scheduling

4. **User Accounts**
   - Add optional cloud sync
   - Enable progress sharing

5. **Additional Word Types**
   - Expand to include more grammar patterns
   - Add counters and expressions
